{"name":"Starsearch","tagline":"StarSearch","body":"StarSearch\r\n==========\r\n\r\nStarSearch is a tool for searching through stars by name/location/constellation and showing a specific part of the night sky. \r\n\r\nSo there I was, with my glow in the dark stars, ready to stick them onto the ceiling.\r\n\"Wait!\" I thought. \"What if I put up my favorite constellation, Orion, and could look at it even if it was cloudy outside?\"\r\n\"Hmmmm....it has to look right though. Let's draw a map and see where the coordinates are.\"\r\nAfter some online star lookups, our hero realized that mucking through by hand is not the way to go.\r\n\r\nSo, for anyone who wants to know accurately where to place stars on the ceiling for that \"Earth's Night Sky\" look, use this app.\r\n\r\nxoxo,\r\n-John\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
